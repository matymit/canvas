Based on my thorough analysis of the actual GitHub repository structure, I can now provide **accurate findings** that correct my initial assessment:

## **Critical Discovery: Pan Tool Architecture Problem**

The pan tool **does not work** because of a **missing viewport store module**. Here's what I found:

### **Root Cause Analysis**

**Missing Viewport Implementation**: The `PanTool.tsx` component tries to call `viewport.setPan()` but the viewport module appears to be incomplete or missing critical methods. The PanTool code shows:

```typescript
const { viewport } = storeState;
if (!viewport?.setPan) {
  return; // This condition is failing!
}
viewport.setPan(newX, newY);
```

This suggests the `setPan` method doesn't exist in the viewport store module [GitHub repository].

### **Architectural Issues Confirmed**

The architecture shows **proper separation**, contrary to my initial misreading:

1. **Single Tool Directory**: Tools are correctly consolidated under `src/features/canvas/tools/` - only contains `EraserTool.ts` and `TableContextMenuTool.ts` [GitHub repository]
2. **React Components**: Tool components are properly organized under `src/features/canvas/components/tools/` [GitHub repository]
3. **Store Integration**: The `PanTool` correctly tries to use the Zustand store as single source of truth [GitHub repository]

### **Specific Pan Tool Problems**

1. **Store Method Missing**: `viewport.setPan()` method is not implemented in the store
2. **Fallback Failure**: The fallback code directly manipulates the stage, but this conflicts with the store-first architecture
3. **Layer Position Bug**: `FigJamCanvas.tsx` applies pan to individual layers rather than stage position, which could cause coordinate issues [GitHub repository]

## **Corrected Assessment**

```json
{
  "summary": "Pan tool fails because viewport store module lacks setPan method, despite correct architectural separation",
  "constraints": [
    "Store-first pattern correctly implemented but incomplete",
    "Viewport state exists but missing critical pan methods",
    "Layer-based panning may conflict with event coordinates"
  ],
  "hotspots": [
    "src/features/canvas/stores/modules/ - missing viewport module methods",
    "src/features/canvas/components/tools/navigation/PanTool.tsx - correct implementation blocked by missing store method",
    "src/features/canvas/components/FigJamCanvas.tsx - layer panning vs stage position confusion"
  ],
  "patches": [
    "Implement setPan method in viewport store module",
    "Add proper viewport state management with pan coordinates",
    "Fix coordinate system: use stage position OR layer positions consistently, not both",
    "Ensure viewport store methods are properly exposed to components"
  ],
  "perf": [
    "RAF batching in PanTool is correctly implemented",
    "Event handling uses proper Konva namespaced events"
  ],
  "sources": ["Direct GitHub repository analysis via API"]
}
```

My initial file structure analysis was **incorrect due to misreading the text file**. The actual repository is better organized than I initially assessed, but the core issue remains: **incomplete viewport store implementation** preventing the pan tool from functioning [GitHub repository].
