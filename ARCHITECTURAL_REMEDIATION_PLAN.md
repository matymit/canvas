This directly addresses performance issues where PanTool might have tried to schedule too many frames (as noted by console spamming earlier):contentReference[oaicite:27]{index=27}.",

That means restoring the plain `requestAnimationFrame` approach with the rafRef cancellation. Use git to revert the changes in PanTool.tsx introduced by this task. This will bring back the original behavior. After rollback, performance might degrade under heavy input, but functionality will be correct. If rollback is needed, likely the RafBatcher integration had a bug (maybe a missed call to flush or an import issue). Identify and fix that, then try reapplying. Because this is an isolated performance enhancement, rolling it back does not reintroduce any architecture violations – it only sacrifices some optimization."

A safe approach: instantiate a RafBatcher in each tool module (or even reuse the same via a module-level const). For testing, separate instances per tool is fine. Add `const rafBatcher = useRef(new RafBatcher()).current;` in the component if needed. Compile the files to catch any issues.",

        "Manual test: Draw rapidly with Pen, Marker, Highlighter. These tools already were quite optimized (they set rafPendingRef to avoid stacking multiple RAF calls). The difference now is a subtle internal one: using a centralized batcher could allow coordinating across tools in the same frame (though usually you only draw with one tool at a time). Verify drawing feels the same or smoother if any difference. There should be no new lag in line rendering behind the cursor. If anything, CPU usage should drop if it was spiking on very fast scribbles.",

You should see that the number of calls to update the Konva Line points is at most ~60 per second. If previously the code might have attempted more in rare cases, now it’s bounded strictly by RAF. The frame rate should stay at or near 60fps even when drawing quickly, indicating success.",
        "No console errors should occur. Specifically, verify that our replacement of the closure around requestAnimationFrame didn't break context (`lineRef` and `pointsRef` should still be available inside the scheduled function). The closure capturing them should still work because we schedule an arrow function in the same scope. Confirm that drawn lines still follow the pointer accurately and finish properly on pointer up (rafPendingRef resets, commitStroke still called)."

        "Pen, Marker, and Highlighter tools now all use RafBatcher to throttle their onPointerMove updates. This means the internal `rafPendingRef` approach is backed by a robust mechanism: no matter how fast the pointer moves, the line points array is updated and redrawn at most once per frame. This prevents any potential performance degradation for extremely fast drawing motions.",
        "User experience remains high-quality: drawing lines with these tools is just as responsive as before – there is no perceptible lag between the cursor and the line. However, behind the scenes the CPU is doing less redundant work, which can improve battery life and ensure consistent frame pacing even on lower-end devices.",
        "We have consistent RAF batching across the board for dynamic interactions: PanTool (T16) and drawing tools (T17) all use the shared approach. This consistency fulfills the requirement for integrated RAF usage as mentioned in the blueprint (achieving **60fps target through RAF batching**:contentReference[oaicite:30]{index=30}). Any future tools or animations can also leverage this RafBatcher, reinforcing a performance-conscious development pattern.",
        "Overall, the canvas system now demonstrates robust performance optimization: even under heavy interactive use (quick pans, fast scribbles, simultaneous changes), the architecture handles updates efficiently. This contributes to meeting the success metric of sustained 60fps rendering under typical use, as outlined in the audit’s success criteria:contentReference[oaicite:31]{index=31}."

        "If any of the drawing tools exhibit issues after this change (e.g., the line lags too far behind cursor or doesn’t draw smoothly), consider rolling back the change for that specific tool. Since each tool was changed similarly, isolate which one has a problem (if any). Reverting is straightforward: restore the original `requestAnimationFrame` logic in the tool’s onPointerMove and remove the RafBatcher usage. Because the tools were already using an RAF throttle before, a rollback simply returns to that working state. After rollback, you can debug why the batcher integration caused a lag – perhaps the batched tasks were interfering with each other if using a shared instance. One possible solution instead of full rollback is to give each tool its own RafBatcher to avoid any cross-talk (if we tried sharing one globally). If issues persist, stick with the original per-tool RAF method (which was already decent) and revisit global batching later. Rolling back this does not break any other improvements; it only affects performance optimization for drawing, so it's safe to do per tool as needed."
