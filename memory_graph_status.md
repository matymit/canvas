### Memory Graph Refactoring Status

**Date:** 2025-09-27

**Issue:** The memory graph server is currently unresponsive or returning malformed JSON responses. All memory-related tools (`memory_read_graph`, `memory_create_entities`, etc.) are failing with a JSON parsing error. This has halted the ongoing refactoring of the memory graph.

**Context:** I was in the process of a major refactoring of the memory graph to improve its organization and utility. The goal was to introduce a more hierarchical structure, separate historical context from the current state, standardize naming conventions, and explicitly log key decisions.

**Completed Steps:**
*   Created parent entities: `Technical Debt`, `Bug Fixes`, `Key Decisions`.
*   Created `LLM Agent` and `Automated Graph Maintenance` entities and linked them.
*   Categorized some existing entities under the new parent topics.
*   Created new `Decision` and `Bug Fix` entities for uncategorized items.
*   Started extracting historical data into `LogEntry` entities. The "Project Critical State - 2025-09-23" log was created successfully.

**Remaining Tasks:**

Once the memory graph server is operational, the following tasks need to be completed:

1.  **Continue Extracting Historical Data:**
    *   Create `LogEntry` for the React 19 upgrade and remove the corresponding observations from the `Canvas FigJam Whiteboard Project` entity.
    *   Create `LogEntry` for the circle text positioning fix and remove the observations from the `Canvas FigJam Whiteboard Project` entity.
    *   Create `LogEntry` for the circle text editor caret positioning fix and remove the observations from the `Canvas FigJam Whiteboard Project` entity.
    *   Create `LogEntry` for the DOM overlay prototype and remove the observation from the `Canvas FigJam Whiteboard Project` entity.
    *   Extract historical data from `Canvas Phase 17 Store Architecture Challenge`, `Canvas Store Typing Strategy`, `AI Conduct Standards`, `kg://active-task`, and `kg://agent-handoff/latest`.

2.  **Rename Entities:**
    *   `kg://active-task` -> `task:multi-agent-system-setup`
    *   `kg://project/canvas/rules` -> `project:canvas:rules`
    *   `kg://agent-handoff/latest` -> `project:agent-handoff:latest`
    *   `kg://project/canvas/status` -> `project:canvas:status`
    *   `programming.ai_tools.glm_4_5_sequential_thinking` -> `tool:glm4.5:sequential-thinking-protocol`
    *   `coding agents` -> `role:coding-agent`
    *   `CANVAS _MASTER_BLUEPRINT.md` -> `file:CANVAS_MASTER_BLUEPRINT.md`

3.  **Final Review:**
    *   Once all tasks are complete, perform a full review of the memory graph to ensure it is clean, organized, and accurately reflects the project state.
