> Archived planning notes for pre-refactor FigJam UX parity work. This document is retained for historical reference and should not be treated as an active roadmap.

Based on my review of the existing code and the comprehensive UX requirements from the FigJam forensic analysis, I need to create a detailed list of changes required to implement the sophisticated interaction model. Let me analyze the current codebase first to understand what's already implemented.

This comprehensive implementation plan will bring the canvas to full FigJam feature parity while maintaining the existing modular architecture and performance optimizations. The changes are structured to preserve existing functionality while adding the sophisticated UX features identified in the forensic analysis.[9]

Here is a clear, actionable to-do list derived from the combined FigJam UX specification and the current modular canvas codebase, grouped to minimize risk and maximize parity while staying vanilla Konva-first.[1][2]

### Canvas environment
- [ ] Add dot-grid renderer on BackgroundLayer with density, size, and color controls; expose toggles in viewport/UI state.[3][1]
- [ ] Ensure background layer is fully non-interactive and cached; apply HiDPI per-layer scaling on DPR change.[4][3]
- [ ] Enhance pan/zoom: pointer-relative zoom, pinch-zoom, and closed-hand cursor during drag; wire toolbar +/- buttons.[5][1]
- [ ] Keep UI controls (toolbar, zoom controls, header) screen-space and unaffected by stage transforms.[2][1]

### Selection & transform
- [ ] Implement TransformerManager to attach/detach Konva.Transformer to single and multi-selection with corner/mid handles.[1][2]
- [ ] Style transformer: blue bounding box, circular handles, resize-axis rules for constrained shapes.[2][1]
- [ ] Integrate with selection slice: click select, Cmd/Ctrl toggle, marquee select; keep overlay layer on top.[6][1]
- [ ] Emit transform start/change/end to history and element modules with debounced batch updates.[1][2]

### Text and auto-sizing
- [ ] Create TextMeasurement utility (offscreen canvas) for wrapping and height calculation.[2][1]
- [ ] Implement auto-grow: TextBox height grows with content; Rectangle/Circle vertically expand even to ellipse when overflow occurs.[1][2]
- [ ] Keep Sticky Note font size fixed; rewrap on resize without font scaling; add author line metadata.[2][1]
- [ ] Enter text edit mode immediately after creating text-like elements via DOM overlay editor.[1][2]

### Creation workflows
- [ ] Support single-click placement with default sizes for sticky note, shapes, text, table, and connectors.[7][1]
- [ ] Keep click-drag as secondary flow for shapes with live preview on PreviewLayer, committing on release.[7][6]
- [ ] After creation, auto-select new element and show contextual toolbar above it.[2][1]

### Drawing tools
- [ ] Ensure Marker (opaque) and Highlighter (multiply, translucent) commit to MainLayer; keep highlighter visually behind other content.[3][7]
- [ ] Add pressure-sensitive width modulation to direct drawing; add min-distance point decimation to reduce churn.[8][1]
- [ ] Keep preview drawing on FastLayer with RAF batchDraw; disable perfectDraw and shadow-for-stroke while drawing.[5][8]

### Connectors and anchors
- [ ] Implement connector tool with curved paths, rounded caps, and arrowhead at target end; add anchor hints.[1][2]
- [ ] Snap connector endpoints to shape boundary anchor points; store {targetId, anchorHint}.[2][1]
- [ ] Recompute connector routing live during connected element drag/transform.[1][2]

### Smart alignment
- [ ] Add SmartGuides utility to find edge/center alignments among nearby elements during drag.[5][1]
- [ ] Snap moving element to detected alignment with threshold; render guide lines on OverlayLayer.[5][1]

### Layering & z-order
- [ ] Enforce creation on top for new elements; maintain dedicated z-policy for highlighter behind content.[3][1]
- [ ] Add helpers to temporarily move nodes to Preview/Overlay for drag performance and return on end.[4][3]

### Contextual toolbars
- [ ] Implement floating contextual toolbar above selection: text formatting (size, weight, alignment, lists, links).[2][1]
- [ ] Add color picker for fill/stroke/sticky note; sync changes to store and live node updates.[9][1]

### Viewport & cursors
- [ ] Extend CursorManager mapping for all tools, including pan grab/grabbing states and tool-specific cursors.[5][2]
- [ ] Ensure cursor updates with active tool and during specific interactions (resize, rotate, connect).[1][2]

### History & undo/redo
- [ ] Add operation batching for typing/dragging/transforming; push deltas or inverse ops to history.[2][1]
- [ ] Wire transformer and creation tools to emit history entries on commit.[1][2]

### Performance & polish
- [ ] Add subtle easing animations on creation and transformation; keep under RAF batching.[9][2]
- [ ] Cache complex shapes/long paths and static layers (grid); provide recache utilities.[8][4]
- [ ] Add performance HUD and optional dashboard toggle; surface fps, draw calls, node counts, layer stats.[9][2]

### Collaboration foundations (implied)
- [ ] Prepare presence hooks and action patch broadcasting (no-op stubs) to enable future live cursors and sync.[2][1]
- [ ] Centralize shared timer widget state in store, ready for CRDT/WS integration later.[1][2]

### New files to add
- [ ] features/canvas/components/ui/GridRenderer.ts (dot grid tiling, layer cache)[3][1]
