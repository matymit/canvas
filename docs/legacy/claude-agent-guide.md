# Claude Agent Guidance (Archive)

This file preserves the historical instructions that once lived at the repository root as `CLAUDE.md`. The canonical and actively maintained guidance for all automation agents now resides in `docs/guides/agents.md`.

## Relationship to the Active Guide
- **Authoritative source**: `docs/guides/agents.md`
- **Purpose of this archive**: retain legacy context and any directives that may inform future process reviews.
- **When to read**: only if you need to understand previous expectations or rationalize changes to the current workflow.

## Change Log
- 2025-10-02: Folded actionable content into `docs/guides/agents.md` and moved this archive into `docs/legacy/` as part of the repository hygiene workstream.
