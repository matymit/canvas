    "Merging the highlighter layer into the main layer (task P2-01) could affect selection and ordering. We must ensure highlighter strokes remain non-interactive and always behind other elements. Thorough testing is required to confirm that selection tools and the Transformer do not accidentally pick highlighter strokes, and that highlight rendering order is correct (especially if multiple highlights overlap).",
    "Changing drawing tool commit logic (task P2-02) removes a direct visual placement; if not done carefully, users might momentarily not see a stroke at commit time. We must verify no visual regressions (no flicker or missing strokes) and that undo still recognizes these strokes. The new approach relies on the DrawingRenderer â€“ any bug there could result in strokes not appearing or being duplicated.",
    "Unifying the UI slice (task P2-05) removes duplicated state properties. If any component or function was still using the old properties (e.g., `selectedTool` at root), it will break. We need to update all references to use the new unified `state.ui` structure. Missing one could cause tools not to activate or colors not to apply, so this must be carefully audited.",
    "Viewport culling (task P2-06) introduces conditional skipping of rendering. If the bounds calculation or re-render triggers are off, some elements might not render when they should (e.g., if an element is just at the edge or if we don't re-trigger rendering on viewport changes for those elements). There's a risk that elements remain invisible after panning back into view. We'll need to ensure that any such element will get rendered (perhaps by forcing a reconcile on viewport change or using the existing subscription patterns). Thorough testing of panning/zooming edge cases is necessary.",
    "Integrating a global RafBatcher (task P2-07) changes how frame updates are scheduled. If not integrated correctly, it could cause either missed updates (if we accidentally drop some callback) or double updates. We removed direct `requestAnimationFrame` calls in favor of batcher scheduling; if the RafBatcher is misused, we could see either sluggish updates or, conversely, the batcher flooding frames. We should closely monitor the pan and draw behavior after this change to catch any timing issues.",
    "Marking certain fields as readonly (task P2-13, e.g., element id/type) can reveal assumptions in code. For instance, our duplicateElement code had to change to avoid directly assigning to `id`. If there are other places where code tried to mutate these fields (shouldn't be many), those will now be type errors or broken at runtime. We addressed the known case, but it's a point of caution: the readonly rule might cause compile failures if we missed something, and in a few cases we may need to adjust logic (like constructing new objects rather than mutating).",
    "Enabling stricter lint rules (tasks P2-11, P2-12, P2-13) could potentially break the build if not all violations are fixed. We must run lint and type-check as part of CI to catch any remaining issues. For example, after enabling prefer-readonly, we should verify the code (particularly in tests and less obvious modules) doesn't have easy-to-fix readonly improvements that we neglected, to avoid a flood of warnings or errors.",
    "The extensive refactoring of coreModule and historyModule types (task P2-09) needs to be tested thoroughly. Since we changed many casted references to typed ones, there's a small risk of runtime differences (though in theory it should be a pure type change). We should especially test undo/redo and selection after these changes to ensure no logic was accidentally altered (e.g., if a draft state was not handled as expected).",
    "Any new tests (tasks P2-14, P2-15, P2-16) must be kept in sync with the application behavior. If the app behavior changes slightly (e.g., we change a data-testid or a default tool), the tests might start failing, which could block CI. We should maintain these tests alongside feature changes. Additionally, E2E tests are inherently timing-sensitive; false negatives can occur if the environment is slow. We'll need to make them robust (using appropriate waits or retries).",
    "Finally, documentation updates must be reviewed by the team. Any discrepancy between code and docs can mislead developers. Given we changed the layering model back to 4 layers, all team members must be aware to not introduce a 'fifth layer' concept again. The blueprint should be treated as the source of truth â€“ our changes bring us closer to it, and any future deviation needs conscious decision-making."
