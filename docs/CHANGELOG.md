# Changelog

All notable changes to the Canvas application will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### üéØ Circle Text & Resizing

- Circle text editor and Konva render now share a fixed 70‚ÄØ% inscribed square, centering 20‚ÄØpx text before, during, and after edits
- Circle selections automatically lock aspect ratio so resize handles keep shapes perfectly round
- Removed legacy auto-grow behavior; circles rely on manual resize while keeping editor/renderer alignment in sync

### üß† Mindmap Nodes & Branches

- Added full mindmap renderer with draggable node groups, selectable branches, and debounced edge rerouting that stays anchored to each node‚Äôs right-side connection point
- Mindmap nodes now render as bare text labels with invisible hit areas while bezier branches stroke out from each label, matching the FigJam reference layout
- Rebuilt mindmap tool flow with batched history commits, immediate inline editing, and keyboard child spawning (`Enter`) that drops linked nodes in one transaction
- Introduced shared DOM editor (`openMindmapNodeEditor`) so text remains centre-aligned during and after edits and persists via store updates
- Normalized node/edge styles across renderer, live routing, and persistence to support backward-compatible data while keeping branch visuals consistent

## [2.5.0] - 2025-01-18

### üéØ Table Transformer Auto-Resize Fix

#### Critical Selection System Enhancement
- **Fixed Table Transformer Resize**: Resolved issue where resize frame (transformer handles) didn't update when rows/columns were added or deleted
- **Implemented Selection Version System**: Added `selectionVersion` state and `bumpSelectionVersion()` function in InteractionModule
- **Enhanced SelectionModule**: Added subscription to selection version changes to automatically refresh transformer bounds
- **Improved Table Operations**: All table structure changes now properly trigger transformer updates via version bumping

#### Technical Implementation Details
- **New State Management**: Added `selectionVersion` counter that increments when selected elements change dimensions
- **Automatic Transformer Refresh**: SelectionModule now listens to version changes and recalculates transformer bounds
- **Proper Timing**: Implemented delay mechanism to ensure table rendering completes before transformer refresh
- **Comprehensive Coverage**: All table operations (add/delete rows/columns) now trigger version bump

#### User Experience Improvements
- **Seamless Resizing**: Transformer handles now automatically adjust to new table dimensions after structure changes
- **Visual Consistency**: Resize frame always encompasses the complete table including new rows/columns
- **Proper Selection State**: Table remains selected with updated bounds after add/delete operations

## [2.4.0] - 2025-01-18
