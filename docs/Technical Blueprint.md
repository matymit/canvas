Technical Blueprint for Recreating Your Whiteboard System
Core Architecture Philosophy
Your system should follow a layered, event-driven architecture with clear separation of concerns. The key is maintaining your sophisticated features while simplifying the development and maintenance experience.

1. Foundation Layer (Infrastructure)
Core Technology Stack:

Frontend: React 19 with TypeScript (strict mode)

Canvas Engine: Konva.js 9.3+ for hardware-accelerated rendering

Desktop Runtime: Tauri 2.x for native performance

State Management: Zustand with persistence middleware

Build Tool: Vite 6.0+ for optimal development experience

Performance-First Design Patterns:

typescript
// Optimized layer management (3-5 layers maximum)
interface CanvasLayers {
  background: Konva.Layer;    // Grid, guidelines
  main: Konva.Layer;          // Primary elements
  preview: Konva.Layer;       // Tool previews
  overlay: Konva.Layer;       // Selection handles, UI
}

// Object pooling for performance
class NodePool {
  private pools = new Map<string, Konva.Node[]>();
  
  getNode(type: string): Konva.Node {
    const pool = this.pools.get(type);
    return pool?.pop() || this.createNode(type);
  }
}
2. State Management Layer
Unified Store Architecture:

typescript
interface CanvasState {
  // Core entities with optimized data structures
  elements: Map<ElementId, CanvasElement>;     // O(1) lookups
  elementOrder: ElementId[];                   // Rendering order
  selectedElementIds: Set<ElementId>;          // Fast membership checks
  
  // Spatial optimization
  spatialIndex: QuadTree<CanvasElement>;       // For collision detection
  viewport: ViewportState;                     // Pan/zoom state
  
  // Feature modules
  history: HistoryEntry[];                     // Undo/redo stack
  sections: Map<SectionId, SectionElement>;    // Container groupings
  connections: Map<ConnectorId, ConnectorElement>; // Element relationships
}
Modular State Slices:

elementModule: CRUD operations for canvas elements

selectionModule: Multi-selection and interaction state

viewportModule: Pan, zoom, and viewport management

historyModule: Undo/redo with operation batching

drawingModule: Real-time drawing state and optimization

uiModule: Toolbar state and modal management

3. Rendering Pipeline
Four-Layer Rendering System:

typescript
class RendererCore {
  private layers: CanvasLayers;
  private nodeFactory: NodeFactory;
  private transformer: TransformerController;
  
  render(elements: CanvasElement[]) {
    // Viewport culling for performance
    const visibleElements = this.spatialIndex.query(this.viewport.bounds);
    
    // Batch operations for 60fps target
    this.rafBatcher.schedule(() => {
      visibleElements.forEach(element => {
        const node = this.nodeFactory.getNode(element);
        this.updateNodeProperties(node, element);
      });
    });
  }
}
4. Tool System Architecture
Event-Driven Tool Management:

typescript
interface ToolEventHandler {
  onPointerDown?(e: PointerEvent): boolean;
  onPointerMove?(e: PointerEvent): boolean;
  onPointerUp?(e: PointerEvent): boolean;
  canHandle?(e: Event): boolean;
  priority?: number; // Higher priority tools get events first
}

class ToolManager {
  private tools = new Map<string, ToolEventHandler>();
  private currentTool = 'select';
  
  delegateEvent(eventType: string, event: Event): boolean {
    // Priority-based event delegation
    const sortedTools = Array.from(this.tools.entries())
      .sort(([,a], [,b]) => (b.priority || 0) - (a.priority || 0));
      
    for (const [toolName, handler] of sortedTools) {
      if (handler.canHandle?.(event) && handler[eventType]?.(event)) {
        return true; // Event consumed
      }
    }
    return false;
  }
}
5. Performance Optimization Framework
Memory and Performance Management:

typescript
// RAF batching for smooth animations
class RafBatcher {
  private pendingOperations = new Set<() => void>();
  private rafId?: number;
  
  schedule(operation: () => void) {
    this.pendingOperations.add(operation);
    if (!this.rafId) {
      this.rafId = requestAnimationFrame(() => this.flush());
    }
  }
}

// Spatial indexing for collision detection
class QuadTree {
  query(bounds: Bounds): CanvasElement[] {
    // Only return elements in visible viewport
    return this.elementsInBounds(bounds);
  }
}

// Shape caching for complex elements
element.cache(); // Cache complex shapes for better performance
element.perfectDrawEnabled(false); // Optimize for simple shapes
Development Roadmap
Phase 1: Core Infrastructure (Weeks 1-2)
Set up modern build pipeline with Vite and TypeScript strict mode

Implement unified state management with Zustand and proper middleware

Create the four-layer Konva architecture with optimized rendering

Build the event system foundation with tool delegation patterns

Phase 2: Essential Tools (Weeks 3-4)
Selection tool with multi-select and transformer handles

Drawing tools (pen, marker, highlighter) with direct Konva integration

Basic shapes (rectangle, circle) with smart creation workflows

Text tool with DOM overlay for rich editing

Phase 3: Advanced Features (Weeks 5-6)
Connector system with automatic routing and snapping

Section containers for grouping and organization

Sticky notes with auto-resize functionality

Undo/redo system with operation batching

Phase 4: Performance & Polish (Weeks 7-8)
Performance optimization with viewport culling and object pooling

Accessibility compliance (WCAG 2.1 AA) with keyboard navigation

Plugin architecture for extensibility

Tauri integration with native file operations and system integration

Key Simplification Strategies
1. Reduce Cognitive Load
Single responsibility modules: Each module handles one specific concern

Clear data flow: Unidirectional data flow with predictable state updates

Consistent naming: Follow established patterns for better maintainability

2. Optimize for Performance from Day One
Viewport culling: Only render visible elements

Layer management: Maximum 3-5 layers to avoid performance degradation

Object pooling: Reuse Konva nodes to reduce garbage collection

RAF batching: Batch drawing operations for consistent 60fps

3. Maintain Feature Parity
Your current system has impressive features that should be preserved:

15 comprehensive tools organized in logical categories

Real-time collaboration readiness with CRDT support

Advanced accessibility with full keyboard navigation

Plugin system for extensibility

Performance monitoring with real-time metrics

4. Modern Development Practices
Type safety: Branded types and discriminated unions prevent runtime errors

Testing strategy: Unit tests for pure functions, integration tests for workflows

Performance budgets: Maintain strict performance targets (1.5s FCP, 60fps)

The key to overcoming your current impasse is to rebuild incrementally while maintaining your sophisticated feature set. Focus on creating clear architectural boundaries, optimizing for performance from the start, and ensuring each module has a single, well-defined responsibility. Your current system shows excellent engineering - the restructuring will make it more maintainable and extensible for future enhancements.
