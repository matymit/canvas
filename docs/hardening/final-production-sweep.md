# Final Production Sweep – October 2, 2025

## Overview
Workstream 9 closes out the Canvas hardening program with a release-readiness sweep that validates the production web bundle, desktop build outputs, and supporting documentation. The effort focuses on consolidating the security posture captured in Workstream 8, documenting residual risks, and producing the release notes for the 2025-10-02 build.

## Validation Checklist
- ✅ `npm run build`
  - Status: Success (Vite 7.1.7)
  - Notes: Dynamic import warning for `openShapeTextEditor.ts` (expected, impacts chunk splitting only)
- ✅ `npm run tauri:build:production`
  - Status: Success (Tauri 2.8.x)
  - Artifacts:
    - `src-tauri/target/release/bundle/deb/Canvas_0.1.0_amd64.deb`
    - `src-tauri/target/release/bundle/rpm/Canvas-0.1.0-1.x86_64.rpm`
    - `src-tauri/target/release/bundle/appimage/Canvas_0.1.0_amd64.AppImage`
  - Notes:
    - Added explicit icon manifest (including new `512x512.png`) to satisfy AppImage packaging.
  - Tauri CLI warns about `__TAURI_BUNDLE_TYPE` marker absence (upstream CLI issue). Logged for follow-up.

## Documentation Updates
- `docs/CHANGELOG.md`: Added "Final Production Sweep" entry summarizing build validation, icon remediation, and security posture consolidation.
- `README.md`: Refreshed current status to reflect the hardened toolchain, new security automation scripts, and desktop build readiness.
- `docs/canvas-hardening-plan.md`: Logged completion note for Workstream 9 and linked the sweep report.
- `docs/security/canvas-security-review.md`: Cross-referenced the release notes to close Workstream 8 items (no content change required in this sweep).

## Outstanding Work Items
- **Bundle identifier**: Updated to `app.canvas.desktop` to clear the `.app` suffix warning emitted by Tauri.
- **Tauri CLI marker**: Track upstream fix for the `__TAURI_BUNDLE_TYPE` warning; no functional impact today.
- **Code-level TODO markers** (tracked in backlog):
  - `src/features/canvas/components/tools/content/TextTool.tsx`
  - `src/features/canvas/components/table/TableIntegrationExample.ts`
  - `src/features/canvas/managers/ConnectorSelectionManager.ts`
  - `src/test/mvp/e2e/regression-tests.test.ts`
  - `src/test/archive/integration-skeletons.test.ts`

## Release Notes Draft
```
## Canvas – October 2, 2025 (Release Candidate)

### Highlights
- Locked in the security baseline established during Workstream 8, including Semgrep automation and scoped Tauri capabilities.
- Verified production web and desktop builds, delivering AppImage, DEB, and RPM bundles.
- Added explicit icon manifest with a new 512×512 asset to unblock Linux AppImage packaging.

### Validation
- npm run build
- npm run tauri:build:production
- npm run lint (Baseline from Workstream 8)

### Known Issues
- Tauri CLI emits the `__TAURI_BUNDLE_TYPE` warning. No runtime impact; under observation.
- TODO/FIXME markers remain only in developer tooling, integration skeletons, or tracked regressions (see report).
```

## Next Steps
- Tag the repository once review is complete (recommended tag: `v2025.10.02-rc1`).
- Publish the release notes excerpt above to the release draft and attach the generated binaries.
- Transition the security monitoring scripts to the operational cadence defined in `docs/security/README.md`.
