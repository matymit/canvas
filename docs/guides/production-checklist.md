- [ ] **Canvas Size**: ‚â§ 8,192px maximum dimension
- [ ] **Draw Operations**: ‚â§ 100 operations per frame

### Bundle Size
- [ ] **Total Bundle**: ‚â§ 4MB compressed
- [ ] **Individual Chunks**: ‚â§ 1MB warning limit
- [ ] **Assets**: ‚â§ 512KB individual asset limit

## üîß Vite Production Build

### Build Configuration
- [ ] Verify `vite build` produces optimized output
- [ ] Confirm manual chunking strategy (vendor/canvas/state)
- [ ] Validate asset hashing and compression (gzip/brotli)
- [ ] Remove debug overlays and dev-only features
- [ ] Set appropriate sourcemap policy (`false` for production)
- [ ] Enable tree-shaking and dead code elimination

### Dependencies
- [ ] Confirm no `react-konva` dependencies (using vanilla Konva)
- [ ] Verify Konva is in isolated `canvas` chunk
- [ ] Exclude Tauri APIs from production bundle
- [ ] Remove console logs and debugger statements

### Commands
```bash
# Production build
npm run build

# Build analysis
npm run build -- --analyze

# Performance audit
npm run lighthouse:prod
```

## üèóÔ∏è Tauri Configuration

### Bundle Settings (`tauri.conf.json` / `Cargo.toml`)
- [ ] Set unique reverse-DNS identifier: `com.canvas.app`
- [ ] Configure product name, version, and description
- [ ] Define target platforms (Windows: NSIS/MSI, macOS: app/dmg, Linux: deb/rpm/appimage)
- [ ] Set appropriate icons for all platforms
- [ ] Configure minimum OS versions and WebView constraints

### Security Hardening
- [x] **Content Security Policy**: Strict CSP with no unsafe-inline/eval
- [x] **Capabilities**: Minimal permissions (window, dialog, fs-read/write only)
- [x] **IPC Validation**: All data crossing boundaries validated
- [x] **Remote Origins**: Only updater/telemetry endpoints allowed
- [x] **WebView Surface**: Minimize exposed APIs
- [x] **Dependency Security**: Zero high-severity vulnerabilities (axios removed)
- [x] **Supply Chain Security**: Minimal external dependencies in build tools

### Configuration Files
```json
// tauri.conf.json (v1) or Cargo.toml (v2)
{
  "security": {
    "csp": "default-src 'self'; connect-src 'self' https://api.canvas.app; script-src 'self'; style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline';"
  },
  "bundle": {
    "identifier": "com.canvas.app",
    "targets": ["nsis", "msi", "app", "dmg", "deb", "rpm", "appimage"]
  }
}
```
